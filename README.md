# Toxic-Escape
Hello everyone! This is Toxic Escape, an educational video game developed as a university project. It simulates a planned evacuation during a chemical threat in a chlorine factory. The goal is to teach players basic safety measures in case of an emergency, while facing dynamic obstacles, timed events, random challenges, and conditional decisions.
